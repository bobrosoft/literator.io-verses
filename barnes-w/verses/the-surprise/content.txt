As there I left the road in {May},
And took my way along a ground,
I found a glade with girls at {play},
By leafy boughs close-hemmed {around},
And there, with stores of harmless joys,
They plied their tongues, in merry {noise}:
Though little did they seem to fear
So queer a stranger might be {near};
Teeh-hee! Look here! Hah! ha! Look {there}!
And oh! so playsome, oh! so {fair}.

And one would dance as one would {spring},
Or bob or bow with leering {smiles},
And one would swing, or sit and {sing},
Or sew a stitch or two at {whiles},
And one skipped on with downcast {face},
All heedless, to my very {place},
And there, in fright, with one foot out,
Made one dead step and turned {about}.
Heeh, hee, oh! oh! ooh! oo!â€”Look {there}!
And oh! so playsome, oh! so {fair}.

Away they scampered all, full {speed},
By boughs that swung along their {track},
As rabbits out of {wood} at {feed},
At sight of men all scamper {back}.
And one pulled on behind her heel,
A thread of cotton, off her {reel},
And oh! to follow that white {clue},
I felt I fain could scamper {too}.
Teeh, hee, run here. Eeh! ee! Look there!
And oh! so playsome, oh! so {fair}.
