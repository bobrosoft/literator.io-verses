Out of the starless {night} that covers {me},
(O tribulation of the wind that rolls!)
Black as the {cloud} of some tremendous {spell},
The susurration of the sighing {sea}
Sounds like the sobbing {whisper} of two {souls}
That tremble in a passion of {farewell}.

To the desires that trebled {life} in me,
(O melancholy of the wind that {rolls}!)
The dreams that seemed the {future} to foretell,
The hopes that mounted herward like the {sea},
To all the sweet things sent on happy {souls},
I cannot choose but bid a mute {farewell}.

And to the girl who was so much to {me}
(O lamentation of this wind that rolls!)
Since I may not the life of her {compel},
Out of the night, beside the sounding {sea},
Full of the {love} that might have blent our souls,
A sad, a {last}, a {long}, supreme {farewell}.
